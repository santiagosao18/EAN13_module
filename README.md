# EAN13_module
A Python module to create and manipulate code numbers through the EAN-13 standard. 

## 1) Code numbers with the EAN-13 standard

The 13-digit EAN-13 number consists of two main components. The first 12 digits (which in turn can be divided in three groups: 
the GS1 prefix, the manufacturer code and the product code) contain information about a product. The last digit is a verfication 
digit computed from the first 12 digits using a specific formula (you can learn about this in 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Article_Number#:~:text=The%20most%20commonly%20used%20EAN,or%20special%20type%20of%20product)
